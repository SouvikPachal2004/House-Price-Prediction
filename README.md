# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using a supervised machine learning model — **Linear Regression** — based on housing attributes like size, location, and amenities. The dataset used in this project is `housing_price_dataset.csv`.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 Goal: Predict house prices using historical housing data.
- 📂 Input: Structured CSV file with features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
- 📈 Output: Predicted sale price of a house.
- 🧠 Model: Linear Regression (with train/test split and evaluation).
- 📊 Visualization: Actual vs Predicted scatter, KDE plots, and correlation heatmap.
